# dropbox.js Build Directory

dropbox.js is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), and its
source code is in the `src/` directory. The `lib/` directory contains the
compiled JavaScript produced by the build process.

Build products are not checked into the dropbox.js git repository, so this
directory will be empty when browsing the source code on GitHub, or in a fresh
checkout.

To populate the directory, follow the step-by-step guide in ihe
[development guide](../guides/development.md).
