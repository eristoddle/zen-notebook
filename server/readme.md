# Eventual home of a Laravel based server

Yes, there used to be one here but it was in at least a two year old version Laravel and didn't do much yet, so just hanging around wasn't very useful.

I figure once I get some time to work on it, I can get the latest version then and whatever does what Laracogs does at that time to get things up and running quickly.

This will only be a rest api. There is a web component to the application but that will be in Angular2 and make api calls to the server.
