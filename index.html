<p><img src="http://stephanmiller.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/screenshot.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When I was 14, I bought Writing Down the Bones by Natalie Goldberg. I have kept up with writing practice off and on 
for over two decades now. Many times in the last few years, I have searched for something in an electronic version 
that I could use easily from a laptop, when I wanted to. Something I could just click on and start writing with. If I
 got caught up in the setup and configuration of the damn tool, the moment could be gone fast, 
 because at the same time I like to write, I am also a nerd at heart and can tweak out on this type of stuff. So the 
 only solution is to get to the writing quickly and not have to worry about anything going wrong.</p>
<p>I found Red Notebook and ZenPen in the same week and an idea just came together. </p>
<p>And of course, being the nerd again, thought of all the other writing tools I would want distraction free and 
simplified. So now, the final version is kind of up in the air.</p>
<h2 id="features-currently-in-executable-version">Features Currently in Executable Version</h2>
<p>The application is still in alpha. The most recently version will be in the source code and in the Mac build because 
I am currently working on a Mac. I will keep the executables updated on a regular basis when I have added 
important features or fix major bugs. But I can tell I didn&#39;t start creating executables until I had a version I 
trusted to use on a daily basis as a replacement for Red Notebook. And most of the beta version punchlist items come 
from bugs I found and ideas I had while using it every day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distraction free writing environment: All menus and configuration options are hidden until needed. A small barely 
visible nav bar at the top left of the GUI becomes 100% visible when hovered with the mouse. The buttons activate 
various menus. The application can be made full screen.</li>
<li>Emulates a daily journal/diary/notebook in an electronic application: Written content is saved to dates and the 
date can be changed used an interactive calendar</li>
<li>Cross platform: Executables for Windows, Mac and Linux</li>
<li>7 themes: Clicking the yin-yang nav button will change the theme</li>
<li>Custom typewriter theme: uses the MyUnderwood Font and has typewriter sound effects</li>
<li>Custom relax theme: beta, still a little rough, has a background that changes color and a rainfall background sound</li>
<li>Journal saved to simple JSON format</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="download-zen-notebook-executables">Download Zen Notebook Executables</h2>
<p>These are in zip format. They are not installers. I do plan on working on installation package eventually, 
but for now, you can unzip the correct file for your operating system and run the executable for in the resulting 
folder. For the Mac version, just unzip the file and in it you will find a Zen Notebook app you can drag to your 
Application Folder</p>

<h2 id="futute-roadmap">Futute Roadmap</h2>
<p>This is my wish and idea list</p>
<ul>
<li>Sync content to cloud services instead of just the file system</li>
<li>Work on integrating Cordova or PhoneGap to and build first Andriod and iOS versions</li>
<li>Flesh out website. Write writing prompts integration and consider users, writing groups, 
online version and journal post permissions.</li>
<li>Write first full featured plugin which will have a folder/document structure similar to Scrivener. This will 
require a more advanced theming system to change up element display (masonry block, outline, editing).</li>
<li>Integrate PanDoc and consider a web service</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="source-code-in-ubuntu-14-04">Source Code in Ubuntu 14.04</h2>
<p>In order to get nodewebkit to work on Ubuntu 14.04 and later, you will have to make sure to do something like this. I
 would explain it more, but I forget how I figured this out because it was months ago, and now that it finally works,
  I only care that it does. So it may or may not work for you. Anyway you know the process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to run the project</li>
<li>If there is an error, copy it and search on Google</li>
<li>Spend the next hour or two figuring out what the issue is</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, this page here explains a few complicated ways to fix this issue:

<p>But I found out that just creating a symbolic link was easier.</p>
<p><code>sudo ln -sf /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.0</code></p>
