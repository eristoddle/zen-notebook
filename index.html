<p>When I was 14, I bought Writing Down the Bones by Natalie Goldberg. I have kept up with writing practice off and on 
for over two decades now. Many times in the last few years, I have searched for something in an electronic version 
that I could use easily from a laptop, when I wanted to. Something I could just click on and start writing with. If I
 got caught up in the setup and configuration of the damn tool, the moment could be gone fast, 
 because at the same time I like to write, I am also a nerd at heart and can tweak out on this type of stuff. So the 
 only solution is to get to the writing quickly and not have to worry about anything going wrong.</p>

<p>I found Red Notebook and ZenPen in the same week and an idea just came together. </p>

<p>And of course, being the nerd again, thought of all the other writing tools I would want distraction free and 
simplified. So now, the final version is kind of up in the air.</p>

<p>But for now, it is just a journal. The menu is on the top right side of the application and is more visible when 
hovered. Clicking a button in the menu will slide in a panel from the left or the foot of the application for various 
functionality. A notebook is arranged by years, months and days and content is saved to a date when the date is 
changed. The notebook file is saved in plain json. There is various automatic features. The content is always 
automatically saved when the date is changed. If you save the journal file once, 
the location is stored and the current content and journal file will be automatically saved on close.</p>

<p>I am working currently on the alpha executables for Windows, Mac and Linux. Eventually those will be downloadable 
from <a href="http://zen-notebook.com">http://zen-notebook.com</a></p>

<p>The application is still in alpha.</p>

<h2>
<a name="current-roadmap" class="anchor" href="#current-roadmap"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Roadmap</h2>

<ol>
<li>Add Tags</li>
<li>Add Search</li>
<li>Reorganize and refactor current application so that new features can be more modular and plugins can be written 
and bolted on. Work on GUI refinements, since I want the base application to just be gui and menu interaction, 
all functionality will be plugins. Turn the notebook functionality into a plugin. Swat any bugs and bad code in this phase.
Once the application seems semi-bulletproof, A beta version will be released.</li>
<li>Sync content to cloud services instead of just the file system</li>
<li>Work on integrating Cordova or PhoneGap to and build first Andriod and iOS versions</li>
<li>Flesh out website. Write writing prompts integration and consider users, writing groups, 
online version and journal post permissions.</li>
<li>Write first full featured plugin which will have a folder/document structure similar to Scrivener. This will 
require a more advanced theming system to change up element display (masonry block, outline, editing).</li>
<li>Integrate PanDoc and consider a web service</li>

<p>In order to get nodewebkit to work on Ubuntu 14.04 and later, you will have to make sure to do something like this. I
 would explain it more, but I forget how I figured this out because it was months ago, and now that it finally works,
  I only care that it does. So it may or may not work for you. Anyway you know the process.</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to run the project</li>
<li>If there is an error, copy it and search on Google</li>
<li>Spend the next hour or two figuring out what the issue is</li>
</ul><p>Anyway, this page here explains a few complicated ways to fix this issue:

<p>But I found out that just creating a symbolic link was easier.</p>

<p><code>sudo ln -sf /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.0</code></p>
